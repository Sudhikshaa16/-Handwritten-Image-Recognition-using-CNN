# Handwritten-Image-Recognition-using-CNN
 Developed a CNN model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Utilized convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction and trained with Adam optimizer. Visualized model performance using Matplotlib. 
 
# Dataset:
 The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset containing 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9), each of size 28x28 pixels. It includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing, making it ideal for digit classification tasks.

# CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):
 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a specialized class of neural networks designed to process grid-like data, such as images. They are particularly well-suited for image recognition and processing tasks.They are inspired by the visual processing mechanisms in the human brain, CNNs excel at capturing hierarchical patterns and spatial dependencies within images.

# Technologies Used:
 Python was used as the programming language, with TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model. Matplotlib was used for visualization, aiding in performance analysis.

# Getting Started:
 You can run the handwriting_recognition.py in VS Code or Python-supported terminal to execute the handwriting recognition model.

# Result:
